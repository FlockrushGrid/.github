Flockrush Grid is not a "copilot" and not "human-in-the-loop." It is a complete, self-sustaining OS designed for autonomous operations.

It is autonomous-first, governed by a Human-on-the-Loop Policy Mesh.

This organization is the home for the SDKs, API documentation, and technical community for the Grid.

## Genesis: From R&D to OS for Autonomy®
The Grid is the product of years of foundational research at our parent organization, **[@Flockrush](https://github.com/Flockrush)**.

Its architecture is the evolution of "AI Twins" R&D and our breakthrough autonomous material scientist agent. We built the Grid because autonomous agents require an autonomous Nervous System to align, heal, and govern them at enterprise scale.

The result is a self-sustaining system of AI Sentinels—a full C-suite including a CEO, COO, CFO, and our original R&D agent, "The Pathfinder"—all governed by the human-defined Policy Mesh.

## What's Here

This is the central hub for developers building on, and integrating with, the Grid.
