Flockrush Grid is not a "copilot", not "human-in-the-loop." It is a complete, self-sustaining OS designed for autonomous operations.

It is **autonomous-first**, governed by a **human-on-the-loop Policy Mesh**.

This organization is the home for the SDKs, API documentation, and technical community for the Grid.

## Genesis: From R&D to OS

The Grid is the product of years of foundational research at our parent organization, **[@Flockrush](https://github.com/Flockrush)**.

Its architecture is the evolution of **"AI Twins"** R&D and our breakthrough **autonomous material scientist** agent. We built the Grid because autonomous agents *require* an autonomous OS to orchestrate, heal, and govern them at enterprise scale.

The result is a self-sustaining system of AI Sentinels—a full C-suite including a CEO, COO, CFO, and our original R&D agent, **"The Pathfinder"**—all governed by the human-defined Policy Mesh.

## What's Here

This is the central hub for developers building on, and integrating with, the Grid.

* **`/docs`**: The official API documentation, "getting started" guides, and tutorials.
* **`/sdk`**: SDKs (e.g., Python, TypeScript) to connect your applications to the Grid.
* **`/whitepapers`**: Technical deep dives on our core architecture, including:
    * The "Policy Mesh" Governance Model
    * The "Inter-Agent Fabric" (IAF) for A2A protocols
    * "The Pathfinder": The R&D-to-Market Agent
* **`/tools`**: Open-source tools and templates to accelerate integration.
